                        coastline, and everywhere else in between.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our legendary hospitality is one that we are truly proud of, and will forever remain synonymous
                        with
                        our name - wherever you may cross paths with us on your travels far and wide.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our spaces have also been designed to seamlessly blend the finest of Sri Lankan hospitality with
                        the
                        nature of our surroundings, creating atmospheres of undiscovered luxury that you will find hard
                        to
                        match. With rooms that draw you into a world of their own, and signature dining experiences that
                        transport you to a world beyond, your stay with us is a stay to remember. No matter how long you
                        choose to spend with our family, we will always welcome you with open arms and a tropical
                        embrace to
                        make you feel at home.</p>

                    <p>As you explore our island, the smiles of our people will accompany you through the many natural
                        spectacles and historical wonders on your journey. And although our home may hold fascinating
                        legacies, it is also an exotic habitat that we carefully preserve for the future. It is one we
                        share
                        not only with the world, but also with each other – and this is what binds us together as a
                        nation
                        of warmth and compassion.</p>

                    <p>Through uncharted lands or world-famous destinations, our eternal spirit of Sri Lankan
                        hospitality
                        is one that is refreshingly contagious, in the best way possible. For it begins and ends with a
                        simple blessing bestowed upon each and every one of you when you set foot on our land:</p>
                    <p>
                        Ayubowan – may you live long!
